# Password-Manager-Pro1
## Project Scope
This document serves to describe the concept and design of the password manager. It does not include source code but provides a comprehensive overview of the functionalities, security measures, and potential user benefits.

## Security Highlights
- **AES-CBC Encryption**: Ensures robust encryption for sensitive data.
- **PBKDF2 Key Derivation**: Protects against brute-force attacks by securely deriving encryption keys from the master password.
- **Local Storage**: Eliminates exposure to online threats by operating entirely offline.

## Usage Overview
1. **Setup**: Users create a master password during the first run to secure all stored credentials.
2. **Password Management**: Add, edit, delete, and search password entries with ease.
3. **Password Generation**: Create strong, secure passwords that meet stringent security criteria.

## Benefits
- **Offline Security**: Protects sensitive data by avoiding internet exposure.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Simplifies password management without compromising security.
- **Advanced Cryptography**: Utilizes proven encryption algorithms to safeguard credentials.
